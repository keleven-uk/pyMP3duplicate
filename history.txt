V1.1.0

    Added the ability to use different modules to read the mp3 tags.
      Currently tinytag & eyed3 are supported.  [eyed3 could be used to write tags]
      A configuration option was added to specify winch to use.
      Alterations to pyMP3Duplicate.py by above [added procedure scanTags].


V1.0.9

    Amended the option -v, print the version.  This is now handled the same -l for license.
    The short version of licence is also not printed with the version info.


V1.0.8

    Added tqdm - a very cool progress bar for console windows.
      Both countSongs and scannMusic loop now display a progress bar.
      Changed back to glob from os.walk, works better with tqdm.
    Added procedure countSongs to give total to above.
    Removed printing to screen every n iterations of loop,
      not now needed with progress bar.


V1.0.7

    Added two new files.
      myLibrary - a wrapper around dictionary access, used to store song stuff.
      myLicense - holds the print stuff for short license and long license.
    Alterations to pyMP3Duplicate.py by above.


V1.0.6

    Added a toml config file and a wrapper class in myConfig.py.
      The config only holds contents of _version.py i.e.
      application name and version at the moment.
    _version.py removed.
    Alterations to myLogger.py caused by above.
    Alterations to pyMP3Duplicate.py by above.
    Combined the two procedures buildDataBase and scanMusic.
      Almost identical except for the test for duplicates.


V1.0.5

    Changed main loop in scanMusic to os.walk from glob.
      Using os.walk seems faster but only just slightly.
      But gives extra functionality, non music files can be flagged
    Some code clean up.


V1.0.4

    Added an argument to get the time difference, defaults to 0.5s.
    Getting error when writing some paths to the duplicate file,
      'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u03b8'.
      Adding the encoding flag cured this,
    Open(duplicateFile, encoding='utf-8', mode="a")
      Changed the name of the method addKey to addItem.


V1.0.3

    Getting strange errors when trying to print song paths, they where of
      type pathlib.path, now they are all cast to str.
    Getting errors when one of the song lengths was not set, now set to zero
      before doing comparisons.


V1.0.2

    Added an argument to not load the database.
    Added an argument to not save the database.
    Added an argument to build the database only.

V1.0.1

    Added methods to save and load the songLibrary - pickles a directory.
    Added an argument to print the number of songs.
    Added an argument to save output to a file supplied.
    Added an argument to not load database on start. i.e. create new one.


V1.0.0

    basic program completed.
    The program will scan a given directory and report duplicate MP3 files.
