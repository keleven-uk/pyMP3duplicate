V1.06

    Added a toml config file and a wrapper class in myConfig.py.
      The config only holds contents of _version.py i.e.
      application name and version at the moment.
    _version.py removed.
    Alterations to myLogger.py caused by above.
    Alterations to pyMP3Duplicate.py by above.
    Combined the two procedures buildDataBase and scanMusic.
      Almost identical except for the test for duplicates.


V1.05

    Changed main loop in scanMusic to os.walk from glob.
      Using os.walk seems faster but only just slightly.
      But gives extra functionality, non music files can be flagged
    Some code clean up.


V1.04

    Added an argument to get the time difference, defaults to 0.5s.
    Getting error when writing some paths to the duplicate file,
      'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u03b8'.
      Adding the encoding flag cured this,
    Open(duplicateFile, encoding='utf-8', mode="a")
      Changed the name of the method addKey to addItem.


V1.0.3

    Getting strange errors when trying to print song paths, they where of
      type pathlib.path, now they are all cast to str.
    Getting errors when one of the song lengths was not set, now set to zero
      before doing comparisons.


V1.0.2

    Added an argument to not load the database.
    Added an argument to not save the database.
    Added an argument to build the database only.
