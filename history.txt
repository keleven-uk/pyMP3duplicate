V1.05

    Changed main loon in scanMusicd to os.walk from glob.
      Using os.walk seems faster but only just slightly.
      But gives extra functionality, non music files can be flagged
      Some code clean up.


V1.04

    Added an argument to get the time difference, defaults to 0.5s.
    Getting error when writing some paths to the duplicate file,
      'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u03b8'.
      Adding the encoding flag cured this,
    open(duplicateFile, encoding='utf-8', mode="a")
      Changed the name of the method addKey to addItem.


V1.0.3

    Getting strange errors when trying to print song paths, they where of
      type pathlib.path, now they are all cast to str.
    Getting errors when one of the song lengths was not set, now set to zero
      before doing comparisons.
